## Welcome ðŸ˜ƒ

My name is **Wadhah**, and I am pursuing my **PhD at the L3S Research Center** in **Germany**.

I graduated from Bielefeld University in 2022 with a Masterâ€™s degree in Intelligent Systems.

My **research interests** include artificial intelligence, tactile sensing for robots, machine learning, reinforcement learning, robotics, and computer vision.
